# Configuration

  * header. This is the header that will display at the top of all pages. You can use hex escape codes here to format it. e.g "\x1B\x41CuTEL Gateway" would produce red text

# Errors

The gateway will overwrite some errors on line 22 of the menu and re-transmit it back to the client. You should leave this space blank so errors can be printed
